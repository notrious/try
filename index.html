						<h2>Bhutan The Land Of Happiness</h2> 
						<p>Bhutan is a tiny and remote kingdom nestling in the Himalayas between its powerful neighbours, India and China. Almost completely cut off for centuries, it has tried to let in some aspects of the outside world while fiercely guarding its ancient traditions</p>

                        <p> Bhutanese culture is very much influenced by sacred Buddhist values. Bhutanese live by their religious values and respect their gods and deities a lot.As a tiny country with a very small population the need to preserve culture and tradition is amplified.

                    </a>
					 <p id="gk">The national dress of Bbhutan is called the Gho for men and Kira for women.
                    It was introduced during the 17th century by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel to give the Bhhutanese a unique identity.
                    The Gho is a long robe hoisted to the knee and held in place with a Kira, a woven cloth belt, wound tighty around the waist.</p>

                    <p id="knowledge">The dress popular along the Bhutanese womenflok is called the kira. It is ankle-length and is basically a rectangular piece of cloth that wraps around the body. Bhutanese women either wear a full kira (like a dress) or a half kira (like a skirt).
                   The kira is fastened at the shoulders by complicated silver hooks called koma, and at the waist with a belt that could either silver or cloth. </p>

						<h2>Dark side of doma</h2> 
						<p>it is said that in the past higher official used to serve doma infront of other higher official soo they used to cut whole bettle nut and make it into khamto
so while cutting the doma it is believed that they used to stab if the other official is someone they have grudge on.  </p> 
                        <h1>HISTORY about DOMA</h1>
                        <p>Some traditional scholars believe that doma and pani were included as 
auspicious substances in the zhugdrel ceremony by Zhapdrung Ngakwang Namgyel (1594-1651), the religious figure who unified Bhutan
Others even go further to claim that the habit of eating doma, pani, and tsuni was introduced in the eighth century by Guru Rinpoche in order to replace 
the cannibalistic habits of the pre-Buddh</p>
                        <h1>effect on current sitiuation</h1>
                        <p>Doma or betel nut is a key part of Bhutanese culture. It's been consumed widely by many for centuries. 
But doctors warn betel nut chewing comes at a terrible cost.it is an addictive substance with many harmful effects. 
It causes cancer, leading people to an early grave and this is the current situation of bhutan.

                         <h2>National Game Archery.</h2>
						<h1>HISTORY ABOUT ARCHERY</h1><p>Archery in Bhutan is culturally distinctive because it is a martial art practiced among a modern population that abhors killing. Bhutanese people from different social strata find archery one of the most enjoyable sports, being both fun and physical exercise.<strong>Declared as the national sport in 1971,</strong> the inclination of people towards archery in Bhutan started in the 1920s, under the leadership of <u id="u1">Druk Gyalpo Jigme Wangchuk,</u> the second king of the country. However, archery has been practised in the country since long before then.
</p> 
                            <h1>Rules and Tournaments</h1>
                            <p>There are usually two teams in every match, each of them having their own supporters, who cheer for them and motivate them throughout the tournament. Participants usually wear a bright red or orange-coloured uniform during competitions. In traditional matches, thigh-length socks and a robe are also carried. When an arrow hits the board just close to the centre mark, one point is given to him.

For two points, the arrow has to hit the central circle and when the arrow hits the bird's eye, 3 points are marked. With every point being earned, the cheerleaders dance and sing the traditional songs and encourage the participants. To lower down the confidence of the opponent team, constants hootings and booing are also the part of the match. And being a part of this crazy enthusiasm is an experience in itself! No major festival or celebrations are complete without a match of archery in which the entire village comes together to enjoy a marvellous match</p>
						 <h1>Role of Women in Archer</h1>
                            <p> Women's role in archery is very important as they make for the supporting people, whose presence doubles the thrill of the tournament.They bring food for them and dance in joy every time their team hits the target and sing traditional songs to cheer up their own team. This is a great source of motivation for the players, who are being expected to win the match</p>
